This project applies PySpark to a warehouse-style sales dataset to build a modelling-ready analytics layer and predictive models. I segment transactions into High-Value vs Regular using a quantile threshold (rather than discarding valid high-value orders as “outliers”), then train a Spark ML Pipeline (encoding → feature assembly → Logistic Regression) to predict high-value customer behaviour. The notebook includes model confidence interpretation and additional regression work for car-ownership prediction to demonstrate end-to-end feature preparation, training, and evaluation.
